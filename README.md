# Techrock / Tael (WABI PROJECT)
*Project Description*
Tael is a digital token for safe consumer products. Thanks to its ability to be seamlessly integrated by third parties, it allows for a wide token use-case through interchangeability of the loyalty tokens on the blockchain.

Tael’s first use-case is seen in Techrock’s safe consumer products ecosystem. Techrock applies banking-level, tamper-proof NFC smart-labels to consumer goods, pairing them with their digital representations on the blockchain. Consumers ‘touch’ the label with their smartphones to verify a product’s authenticity, discover the product’s journey along the supply chain, and be rewarded for their purchase. Techrock protects products where authenticity matters, such as infant formula, cosmetics, alcohol, and supplements.

Tael tokens are used in the loyalty point ecosystem to reward consumers and encourage behavior in the Techrock channel while generating unique data for all companies in the value chain. 

Tael’s vision is to bring blockchain based payments into the mainstream, across Asia and beyond.

Formerly WaBi token.
